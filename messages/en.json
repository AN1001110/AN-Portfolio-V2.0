      "summary": "I am Abdulrahman Nashaat, a React/Next.js developer and an Agricultural Science student. My mission is to build the bridge between two worlds, developing impactful AgriTech solutions, with Allah's help, that serve the farmer and contribute to a sustainable future, by Allah's will."
    },
    "story": {
      "p1": "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. My compass has always been a profound belief: that we are 'stewards upon the Earth,' entrusted with its cultivation. This is not just a belief, but a call to action, and by Allah's grace, it led me to a passion at a unique intersection: the world of 'The Land' and the world of 'Logic & Programming.'",
      "p2": "My first path was 'The Land.' As a student at the Faculty of Agricultural Science, I witnessed the challenge firsthand. I saw a vast gap between the ancient wisdom of the field and the immense potential of technology. I saw data being lost and decisions made on intuition alone. I realized 'passion' for agriculture needed 'tools' to truly flourish.",
      "p3": "Here, by Allah's guidance, I began the second path: 'Programming.' This was not a career change; it was 'equipping for the mission.' At the Information Technology Institute (ITI), I honed my skills as a Front-End Developer. I didn't just learn React and Next.js as technologies; I learned them as tools to build 'bridges' and solve problems.",
      "p4": "My mission, by Allah's will, is to *be* that 'Bridge.' I am not just a developer who writes code, nor just an agricultural student who analyzes soil. I am an 'AgriTech' developer who comes from the heart of the field. My goal is clear: to transform complex data into 'impactful tools' and clear insights that serve the farmer and the engineer.",
      "p5": "I believe this work is 'cooperation in righteousness and piety.' I ask Allah to open the doors of goodness for me, and to bless me with a righteous work environment where I can contribute beneficial knowledge, and be part of a more sustainable and prosperous agricultural future, by Allah's will."
